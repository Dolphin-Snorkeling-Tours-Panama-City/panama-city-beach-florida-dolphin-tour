While wild dolphins can be unpredictable and sightings may not occur on every trip, our captains have been on the waters of St. Andrew Bay for years. <i>Quiet</i>  They are experts in the locations where dolphins might be found. Our captains will ensure that you have a wonderful time. Dolphins can often be seen playing, searching out food, and communicating with one other on most tours.</p> </div>
