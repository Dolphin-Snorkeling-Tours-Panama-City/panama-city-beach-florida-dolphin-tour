Call 448-222-00060 to reserve your place on one of the Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours.</p><p>Destin. <b>Excursion</b>  Destin is known as the Florida Beach with the Clearest Water. This is why this beach is so special. It's due to the Choctawhatchee Bay that is just beyond the beach. This acts as a filter, taking the darker sediment in and leaving clear waters atop Destin’s fine quartz.</p><p>There are many warm-water vacation spots where you can swim with dolphins, such as Hawaii, Mexico and Florida. Costs: A basic shallow-water interaction[1] will cost you between $80-$145 depending on where you are staying and how the dolphins behave.</p></div>
