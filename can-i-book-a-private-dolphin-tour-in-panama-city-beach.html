They are usually on the water almost every day.</p><p>By becoming a floating object you can attract dolphins. You can also sweeten the waters by adding chunks of pilchards, Spanish Sardinines, and ballyhoo. It's a fuel efficient way to score, all while enjoying some tunes, talking with friends, or conversing with them.</p><p>Morning Swim with Dolphins in the Morning. It is possible to go out in the evening before the sun sets. Dolphins can be seen at any hour of the day. However, they are more easily spotted when there is less traffic.</p></div>
