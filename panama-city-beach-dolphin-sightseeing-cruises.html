<div> <p>How to communicate with wild dolphins. <b>Enjoyment</b>  Other foods are prohibited. Give dolphins plenty of space and avoid touching them. ... Be familiar with the laws. ... Be aware of signs that indicate a problem.</p><p>Do not touch the dolphins. The dolphins will attempt to make physical contact with you if they feel the need. Touching one dolphin will cause them to leave the area. This not only affects dolphin behavior, but also causes irritation to other members of your group as everyone loses in the swim.</p><p>In order to protect the well-being of these wonderful marine creatures, Florida law prohibits swimming with dolphins as well as touching or feeding them. Officers from the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission are on the water to ensure that these rules are followed. However, you may be lucky enough to have dolphins approach the tour boat quite closely, giving you an excellent view and great photo opportunity. If you would really like to have the possibility of encountering wild dolphins in the water, taking one of our Shell Island Snorkel Tours is a good option as the dolphins sometimes swim near snorkelers.</p></div>
